# Introduction

Named after the Chinese mathematician Mei-Ko Kwan who posed the problem in 1962.

The problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of an (connected) undirected graph at least once.

## Formal definition

Given a connected weighted graph or digraph G, the Chinese Postman Problem is the problem of finding the shortest circuit that uses each edge in G at least once.

## Important Property for General Solution

Suppose G is a graph with 2k odd vertices, where k â‰¥ 1, and suppose C is a circuit that traces each edge of G at least once. Then the retraced edges in C can be partitioned into k paths joining pairs of the odd vertices, where each odd vertex in G is an endpoint of exactly one of the paths.
