# Introduction

Catalan numbers are named after Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan.

Catalan numbers are a sequence of positive integers that enumerate combinatorial structures of many types, examples include:

- nonnegative paths in the plane
- well-formed sequences of parentheses
- full binary trees
- stack permutations
- and many more...

## Definition

The Catalan number c_n, for n ≥ 0, is given by

$$c_n = rac{1}{n+1}C(2n,n)$$
